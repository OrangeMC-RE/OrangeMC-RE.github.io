OrangeMC was planned as a Minecraft mini-game server that created by [@ShiinaSekiu](https://github.com/ShiinaSekiu). But unfortunately she has completely stopped her activity after a conflict in a vulnerabilities discovery and is likely dead because of her depression. We are gonna still honor her contribution to OrangeMC and its members.

OrangeMC is now completely refactored its structure and still under heavy construction even though current developer called [@Astro angelfish](https://github.com/astro-angelfish), which is a fish and busy with its university, security research and kinds of developments.

Parts of technique of developing OrangeMC and vulnerability/CTF write-ups will be uploaded there. And OrangeMC will also make few of its libraries open-source, making everyone free from complex problem that had already been resolved by OrangeMC members.

Current Members:
 - [@X\_Zero](https://github.com/X-zero0w0)
 - [@Astro angelfish](https://github.com/astro-angelfish)

OrangeMC currently do only have an official [github account](https://github.com/OrangeMC-RE). If there's more social account, an update will be posted here.
